It was a fun one to read to my kids and the tale will stick with them for a long time.\\n\\n3. Nighttime Nap – Babar\\n\\nThis book was one of the very first books my daughter learned to read by herself. She was around 3 or 4 at the time and still loved the beautiful illustrations in the Babar series. It’s also fun to read the few words that my daughter could read at the time, and then ask her to predict what the word might be. I still read this one to my kids before they go to bed.\\n\\nI’ve always been a fan of Babar and this series of books is no different. They are a fun and easy way to get kids interested in books. They are simple, but they are beautiful too.\\n\\n4'"
